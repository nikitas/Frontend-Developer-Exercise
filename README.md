# Frontend Developer Exercise 2.7

## Introduction

The purpose of this exercise is for the developer to exhibit his familiarity with frontend technologies, programming patterns and to provide with a sample of what clean and reusable code means to the candidate.

Please put your comment about the decisions you have made inline, and give a summary about the architectural choices that you considered. Please don’t use ES6.

## Exercise
We will use http://ergast.com/mrd/ to create a single page application that presents a list that shows the F1 world champions starting from 2005 until 2015.  Clicking on an item shows the list of the winners for every race for the selected year. We also request to highlight the row when the winner has been the world champion in the same season.

You can adjust the UI how you see fit for the best result, but sticking to a single page application is mandatory.

## Ergast Developer API

## UI/UX
We take pride that we create a lean solutions, with focus on UX. Your UI should reflect the same principles. Try creating something simple, user friendly and eye appealing. Feel free to use any UI resources you’d like to achieve that. For example you could use Twitter Bootstrap, or any other UI library.

## Architecture
There is no limitation, design your application anyway you want. Focus on clean, reusable code. Focus on frontend best practices. Show us that you know how to produce high quality modern web applications.

## Libraries
You can use any libraries you think are best but we would love to see your skills with AngularJS.

## Backend
No Backend required. We should be able to run the exercise, just by opening your index.html file.

## Extra points
Delivery the exercise with a readme file that explains what you have done.
